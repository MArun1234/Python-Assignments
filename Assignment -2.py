get_ipython().set_next_input('Q1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'them')
Ans.

The two values of the Boolean data types are 'True' & 'False'
'True' is indicated with the value 1 & 'False' is indicated with the value 0

Boolean data type is mainly used to compare the things in Python 
if the comparision condition is ssatisified then it willl print 'True' or else it will print 'False'


Example:
x = 5
y = 10
print(bool(x==y))
#in the above example we are checking whether x is equal to y
if its yes it will print 'True' and since clearly those two are  not equal it will print 'False'

Q2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators

Ans. 
The three basic boolean operators are: AND, OR, and NOT

AND searches find all of the search terms. 
OR searches find one term or the other.  
NOT eliminates items that contain the specified term

Q3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

Ans:
    Combinations with ' AND'
    
True and True is True. 1 and 1 is 1
True and False is False , 1 and 0 is 0
False and True is False , 0 and 1 is 0,
False and False is False , 0 and 0 is 0,

Combinations with 'OR
'
True or True is True, 1 or 1 is 1
False or True is True, 0 or 1 is 1
False or False is False,0 or 0 is 0

Combinations with 'NOT'

not True is False, not 1 is 0
not False is True, not 0 is 1


Truth table for And is 

A B output
0 0 0
0 1 0 
1 0 0
1 1 1

Truth table for or is 

A B output
0 0 0
0 1 1 
1 0 1
1 1 1


Truth table for not is 

A output
0 1
1 0

get_ipython().set_next_input('Q5. What are the six comparison operators');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'operators')

Ans. 
 ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= are the six comparison operators


# In[ ]:


Q6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Ans. 

== is the equal to operator that compares two values and evaluates to a Boolean, 
while = is the assignment operator that stores a value in a variable.

Q13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
get_ipython().set_next_input('importing spam');get_ipython().run_line_magic('pinfo', 'spam')
Ans.

This function can be called with spam.bacon().
